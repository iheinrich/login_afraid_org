### Installation and use
:sparkles: Clone or download source code then execute ```dev/setup.sh``` to install required environment. Setup requires Python >= 3.8. Setup will display useful commands after installation.<br>
:recycle: A standalone executable for your system[^1] can be built after setup. If you're only interested in the standalone executable you can remove the source code folder after build.

[^1]: <small>Linux is tested and works for current Debian/Ubuntu. Windows and Mac should also work but are untested. Binaries for a specific OS can only be created *on* that OS, no cross-build.</small>

### Development
:see_no_evil: The current version *works for me*<sup>:tm:</sup>. If afraid.org should ever change their page the code will probably be adapted.<br>
:loudspeaker: If you notice it stopped working, or if it doesn't work for you, please open an issue. I'll do my best to get to it as soon as possible.
